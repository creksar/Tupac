# Tupac Thanks for checking out the GitHub!

This is a pproject made for fun - don't take it seriously.
It is made based on changes data ranges and values within the script of a 2015 baseplate leak of the game Phantom Forces. 
The game was made in 2015, so theres already a base game to go off. The game is more meant to be a modded or alteration of the baseplate.
Visual changes are hard to make due to the nature of the script; though I do have prior experience in coding in LUA.
Visual changes are backed up on the PF serverbase so not really much I can do.
Anyway, thanks for checking out the update page and make sure to stay posted for any updates made to the game!
